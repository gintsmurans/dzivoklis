It is so good, that I decided even to write about it here. Currently we do this only on development environment for safety, because the page code is quite old. Anyways, every php development should do this to get rid of php's annoying error reporting and hopefully make a better product. So enough talking, here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;

(I will not talk about obvious ones like unicode and unix/win/osx line ending support, fast, good UI, etc) And those are: sftp browser and just a good editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody seems to ever get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TextMate seems to be fast, but lacks sftp support. Same for sublime (which is also just weird editor). Same for Kod. Same for lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are editors with bunch of features, but are so terribly slow or lacks design so much or just can't seem to get some of the features right. For example eclipse and all its crazy movement. Or komodo with its seems-to-be-unfinished sftp panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are few those that shine out like Espresso and Coda. They are not bad at all, but for example Espresso is kind of slow on my computer and I can't get used to its sftp browser.

On the other hand Coda is nicely made and is full of features, but I don't really use them all so from my point of view it could be much lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me Coda seems to be the best of them all. At least as far as I know all is. It would be great if Coda would make a "Coda Lite" version and sell it for like $15-25. $99 is too much for the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibility to add sftp sites like bookmarks or whatever, just without site loading thing to make it faster. It can as well be just a good looking list;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SFTP and probably a local file browser, its pretty good as it is already;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document splitting could be useful;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same editor;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same text possibilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same file and syntax highlithing support + bash scripting could be also useful;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+Trim trailing whitespace. Maybe even a setting checkbox that would allow to trim trailing whitespace before each save;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+A possibility to sort folders before files in a file browser;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+Lion full screen support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hints, no clips, no validation, no sharing, maybe no code navigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Why? I have opened the tab once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal: OSX have pretty nice terminal application it self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS: Its faster to write css value than search for it in all those fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it all makes it work faster then it would be a really great editor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2012"></category></entry><entry><title>Carrots</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/carrots.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-26T12:15:00+03:00</published><updated>2011-09-26T12:15:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-09-26:/en/carrots.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are from my parents garden..&lt;/p&gt;

So if you want to hide back button you have to hide it in first view controller and then push the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have many places where you need to push new view controllers and have back button, but only one place where it needs to be set it is not very efficient to set it every time to not hidden. The solution is this code called from view controller pushed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parentViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;navigationItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setHidesBackButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to show it when view disapears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also applies to custom back buttons - you have to apply it to first view controller, not the one is being pushed on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry><entry><title>Comparing posterous and google analytics statistics</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/comparing-posterous-and-google-analytics-statistics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-22T18:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-22T18:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-03-22:/en/comparing-posterous-and-google-analytics-statistics.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Of course I would like to have my site viewed as much as posterous says, but I think I can be sure, that google analytics is more correct.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime HD camera.&lt;/strong&gt; Macbook cameras has always been very good, this one seems even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would make me buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluray.&lt;/strong&gt; I had some 40GB of photos that I accidentally deleted. So I was really hoping, that in spite of internet comments apple would surprise everyone and put it in the new macbook. They didn't, shame for them. This would really be the key for me to buy it. If we do some math, then I need 10+ DVD disks to save all those pictures + DVD are still quite unreliable and it is not that I will have smaller amounts of pictures after writing all those 40GB. Now with bluray I could write two copies of pictures in two disks instead of 10 unreliable dvd disks in one copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen Resolution.&lt;/strong&gt; This is another disappointment. Apple increased screen resolution for macbook air and now it is larger than new macbook pro has. I am used to work on 13" laptop and I don't want to change that, but larger resolution would make me much happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USB.&lt;/strong&gt; 2 usb ports are just too less. 4 is optimal. I know, that their number will never be increased, but still. Lets assume that I have iphone charging in one of usb ports and wired mouse into another one. Now when I need to attach photo camera I have to pull one out, but I don't want to, because iPhone needs to be charged, but I need the mouse to operate (which I don't, but I am trying to make a point here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something really, really cool, that nobody has made yet.&lt;/strong&gt; Like that 3D desktop that was going around the internet once, or I don't know, controlling mouse with my mind. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have unibody as I have 3 years old macbook white. It is really cool, but it is just a fancy thing as an add-on to the price we are paying. We all know apple is not quite cheap. Please don't misunderstand me, I am not complaining that they cost too much. I am very happy that I bought one those 3 years ago. I have reinstalled it once in 3 years, I can't complain about anything. :) I am just saying that unibody is not a reason to buy new laptop if current one if working just fine. Still for the first time, I am disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, in the next faster, better, never seen before release of MacBooks, please, include also really useful things, not just fancy faster toys.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry><entry><title>Sleepy Louise</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/sleepy-louise.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-22T12:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-01-22T12:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-01-22:/en/sleepy-louise.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is another video with little Louise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry><entry><title>Code Cards v1.2</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/code-cards-v12.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-11T23:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-01-11T23:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-01-11:/en/code-cards-v12.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to mention, that since yestereday &lt;a href="http://codecards.gm.lv/"&gt;Code Cards 1.2&lt;/a&gt;  have been approved and is available on &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-cards/id412350680?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About learning. Some month ago, college of mine came up with an idea. You see in Latvia we use username, password and phisical code cards (there are other options, mostly paid solutions) to authenticate within online internet baking websites. So this college of mine thought: "How cool would be if my code card would be stored on my phone and I wouldn't have to take that card with me?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I thought: "What a nice idea." Then we talk a bit about it and as I have macbook and he have android mobile phone, we decided that I will create an iPhone version, but he Android's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been very interesting experiance, because it has been a long time since my last compile-type development. On other hand I have never thought about memory allocation and releasing so much as with this app. From beginning when I saw Objective-C I thought - wtf? - quares all around. But now it somehow seems kind of a cool language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to dive into specifics of language as this blog post is meant to be only superficial overview of what I am doing, maybe next time. Anyway, the application now is published in &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-cards/id412350680?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; . It took 3 days for apple to publish it, suprisingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it for iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few days ago I thought I could make some android live wallpaper and sell it. :) At that point I didn't know what to make so I left the thought alone. A day later I somehow remebered a little work I made ~10 years ago on pascal. It was just some random circles showing in random sizes. You know the rest. :) You can find it on market searching for Circles Live Wallpaper or lv.gm.circleslivewallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EFyp294g1U"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Google market ir really not so advanced as Apple, but it have one advantage over it - you don't have to wait for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to say nice words about Chrome Extensions. It is so simple to create one, I am really amazed.

&lt;p&gt;In professional area I have developed my first iPhone application. Objective-c is not an easy programming language. Actually it is kind of weird. Anyway I made an application, that have 3 buttons, a loader and a web browser. Pressing on the buttons takes to 3 different websites and current website is saved to sqlite db file so next time application is started it remembers which button was pressed. In general nothing impressive, but it is a start. I am planning an update to show nearest places on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also updated structure of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gintsmurans/staticphp/tree/structure"&gt;staticphp framework&lt;/a&gt; . Currently it is on the new branch, but eventually I will merge the changes in master branch, when I will be certain that this is the right way to go. I will try to post a separate post about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life we are still looking for a apartment to rent. This has been very disappointing area. Currently we live in another city some 40 km away and I have to drive everyday a lot. I haven't mentioned it on the blog, but for a while we have been looking for a new place to live in Riga. At this time there are three kind of apartments available in Riga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First ones are terrible and I mean really terrible ones without any repair ever made. I don't know what people are thinking asking such prices for such apartments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second ones are those "ok" apartments. They could work out, but they don't feel like worth the price or worth the move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third ones are those really nice apartments, where you can very easily imagine your daily life. But they cost a lot. Some owners are asking half of my salary + utilities for a month and of course to pay two months ahead, when starting to live there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to move away from Jurmala, but it seems we will have to move somewhere outside the Riga and it will eventually not solve driving problems. Will have to deal with it some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes also in professional area. I am looking for new job opportunities. I am a little bored from corporate world. I am seeking for new challenges, something interesting instead of website programming for clients, more likely some startup with a thrilling idea behind it. (Facebook would be just fine, although it is not some startup anymore.. :D) Yeah, so, this is not an easy task. I have searched over some job portals and there are actually lot of jobs out there, but most of them are exactly those I don't want. And all those questions: "Freelance no freelance?", "Relocate, stay where I am?" don't make it much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that this is game changing moment in my life. "Ok, here we are, what's next?" is the right question. There are so much options and opportunities that it is hard to choose and specially for me, as I am always looking for some kind of perfection. As for my personality I have become more determined and strict. I guess it is a good thing. Ok, that is it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

And even getting the actual 2.1 update was big times fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery. It is a fu..ing disaster. Today I actually tried to turn on what I would like to use everyday. It last 6 hours before battery was empty. 6 fu..king hours. It is called a mobile phone, not desktop PC.

&lt;li&gt;Touch screen. 1.6 was some kind of nightmare. If I put it on the table, the sliding was not working at all, I had to hold it still in my hand and then slide. But even then sliding over icons stops somewhere at some icon and executes it. In some applications it became so annoying. I wanted to slide over my tweets, but instead what I got was push on the first tweet, still sliding down, push on the menu item and voila I had a new favorite tweet against my will. With 2.1 android is a lot better, but still it seems somehow inaccurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mysterious stuff. The are some stupid and unexplainable things happening. For example I turn it off with no notifications on, but when I turn it on, missed calls shows up, new messages shows up. I pushed the button clear to not to show me those. Next I open notification bar with clean "desktop", but when I slide it up some application is already opened instead of "desktop". Wireless connection is dead after some idle time, but it still shows as connected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance. Overall performance is good. It is better than it was on iPhone 3G with 4.0 iOS, but it is not perfect. Angry birds lags a lot. I get it, it have only around 600 Mhz (My first computer has 1Ghz? :D).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole phone OS seems so random. On the iphone I had a feeling, that it is united system with inside applications. On other hand Android feels .. well a lot like linux - incomplete. Graphics is not so appealing, just like most of linux distros. Like thousands pieces comes together as one system with no information about others. I hope you see the point I'm trying to make here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other hand Sony Ericsson have made mini pro nice looking. I really like it's size, design and it's hardware keyboard. But battery is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am thinking wether to test new blackberry torch or not. It seems nice, but applications running on Java somehow scares me. :) I instantly imagine all those windows Java applications with that cool gray background and little lighter stripes. I will find some time to get to my GSM provider to see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Multilingual websites</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/multilingual-websites.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-15T04:36:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-11-15T04:36:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-11-15:/en/multilingual-websites.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another topic I wanted to cover today is international websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually the last post comes very closely with this one. After
implanting the new translations system, I started to think: “It would
be nice to detect right languge before defining WPLANG, define it
afterward and give back content in that language.” I already had heard
about wordpress mu, but I somehow forgot it. Until I saw somewhere in
wordpress 3.0 roadmap, that is has been merged with wordpress. That
could do the trick. Wordpress codex have very well described how to
enable &lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network"&gt;multisite
wordpress&lt;/a&gt; . Although it
is a bit tricky, specially if your blog already have a content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ - for latvian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/en - for english&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ru - for russian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I would want to store our default blog under /lv directory I would
create another wordpress site and import posts under it from the
default one, and of course create an redirect from / to /lv. Maybe we
will go this way, don’t know it yet. For now blogs haven’t been
translated yet. I could bet we will run in some problems later, but
for now it looks like a good solution for multilingual blogs. Far
better, than giving each language a new copy of wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change interface language of the site, only modifications I had to
do is in wp-config.php file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;  if (strpos($_SERVER[&amp;#39;REQUEST_URI&amp;#39;], &amp;#39;/ru&amp;#39;) !== FALSE)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        define (&amp;#39;WPLANG&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ru&amp;#39;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    elseif (strpos($_SERVER[&amp;#39;REQUEST_URI&amp;#39;], &amp;#39;/en&amp;#39;) !== FALSE)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        define (&amp;#39;WPLANG&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;en&amp;#39;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        define (&amp;#39;WPLANG&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;lv&amp;#39;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I don’t like wordpress (and I am saying it after all
this:), but it has been great if you need to get things done fast and
don’t worry much about performance, or worry a little bit of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacking of the wordpress</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/hacking-of-the-wordpress.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-15T01:41:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-11-15T01:41:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-11-15:/en/hacking-of-the-wordpress.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago one of the web servers started to fail.

&lt;p&gt;So I thought lets take a wordpress and put it under XHProf. It just blow my mind away. It made somewhere around 70 000 function calls. Oh yeah baby.. Today I put a fresh copy of wordpress onto another host and gave it another shot. Without Latvian language pack it makes around of 8 000 function calls. Seems ok. But when I add those language packs it varies somewhere between 50 000 and 60 000 function calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because of wordpress implementation of .mo files. I have always thought it is not the best way for storing language strings. It can't be translated online, it is slow and it takes a lot of memory to load those mo files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have developed a translation tool for some websites and I thought to give it a try. It actually requires a bit of hacking of the wordpress core files, what I know is not the best practice, but still a tryout would be nice. This tool stores translated strings into the database and then there is a php class file on production side that takes those strings out of database and caches in php files as arrays. Cache is refreshed: 1. if apc is enabled, the hash key of site and language is not found there, or 2. the hash key is not found in table &lt;code&gt;cache&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now running this setup XHProf show, that only 17 386 function calls are made, it runs faster and takes less memory and the main thing - you can translate your wordpress interface online. Still lot of function calls, although.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this work, I had to rewrite parts of l10n.php file in wp-includes. Wordpress also would be better, if it would use more arrays as parameters and avoid call_user_func_array at all. I also decreased process count to two, one for each user and with &lt;a href="http://gm.lv/markup-test"&gt;nginx fastcgi caching&lt;/a&gt;  turned on, it can handle approximately 6000 requests per second. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are more interested how I made this, please ask in the comments or by e-mail (gm (at) gm (dot) lv).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>This is not good, not at all</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/this-is-not-good-not-at-all.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-14T00:39:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-11-14T00:39:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-11-14:/en/this-is-not-good-not-at-all.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Img_0380" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/gmlv/BKcKPjVw9dZ7uP2iOzWmaYENrfHzckq5bIAbcc1jqYNCL6hMgbN5gBMFulJz/IMG_0380.jpg.scaled696.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optical zoom and image stabilizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing is fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual controls are nice plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of noise - I'm used to 400D :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash pop ups and I have no idea how to stop it from doing it, I mean I have to look for it in google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom button is a bit strange and somehow interfere if you want it to put in a small bag for camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noisy zooming - in taken movie I can clearly hear it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just for now. I have to try it at daylight, I guess quality will be much better even considering ISO 80. 400D lowest is 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really tired .. good night...&lt;/p&gt;

It was a good purchase, but it somehow was too far from our needs as we mostly took pictures in auto or P mode. Yesterday we actually sold it. Now it was time to look for the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our requirements was that is has to be small, fit into 200 LVL price range and have to be qualitative. After reviewing a lot of cameras we came to two models: &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_sx210is.asp"&gt;Canon SX 210 IS&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Sony/sony_dsct99.asp"&gt;Sony DSC-T99&lt;/a&gt; . Canon offers more control, sony offers smaller size and cooler looking.
Me and my wife we both decided to go for sony, but I couldn't find it in any LV internet shop so I decided to go for canon. As well, reading through some of the posts in forums, confirmed my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is 4:30 am, I have already ordered SX210, so I can finally go to sleep. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Technology and Web 3.0</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/technology-and-web-30.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-19T04:28:00+03:00</published><updated>2010-10-19T04:28:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-10-19:/en/technology-and-web-30.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we all might know right now we use a lot of: jquery, Yahoo!

These technologies have been around, just like asynchronous javascript requests were before Web 2.0, but right now they are being used very actively by making better experiences on mobile phones. Design has been changed from large buttons to small and simple ones to fit into mobile screens.  Currently most of popular applications are built for well know social sites, wikis, blogs. Although there are some popular new collaboration applications on the application market (foursquare, for example), it do have a web interface, but it is more valuable to use it on your phone, than a web browser. I think there will be some new stuff on mobile market, that will get really popular. Right now you don't need a computer with a browser to use the web. Also mobiles will be cheaper, at least the first ones that came out some years ago and even more people will be joining mobile networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future can go in different directions, but it looks to me, that with upcoming &lt;em&gt;4G&lt;/em&gt; mobile network, there will be very few people using full size computers. This is a list of things, that will lead us to completely switch to mobiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;4G &lt;/em&gt;mobile network - mobile providers is already testing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater capacity batteries at the same or even smaller size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better processors and larger memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of projection or hologram as a virtual display and some new input method for better accuracy so you can use: photoshop, illustrator, autocad, maya and such products with a charm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is actually a very close concept from mozilla labs to the future mobile phone: &lt;a href="http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/09/23/seabird/"&gt;http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/09/23/seabird/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like mobile phones are going the same way as PCs were some years ago, just new, smaller format. Imagine ten years ago .. 1Ghz processor was such a power. :) Now some of the newest phones have 1Ghz processor. It is similar migration as it was to PC. Questions remains the same. What comes next? How far can technology possibly go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;Web 3.0&lt;/em&gt;, it is an arguable question if mobile applications really are &lt;em&gt;Web 3.0&lt;/em&gt;, even for my self, but it feels like so. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karlis pointed it out, that some time ago we were migrating from desktop applications to web browsers and now we are migrating from web browsers to mobile applications. For some time we were using web sites as they were, but now you create a service give an api access to developers and developers create tools to actually use the service. Couldn't agree more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>My status</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/my-status.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-13T14:45:00+03:00</published><updated>2010-10-13T14:45:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-10-13:/en/my-status.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;![My_status][{static}/images/2010/my_status.png]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fastcgi_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what we have here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When request to php file come in “location ~ .php$” handles it. If it sees that there is no cookie with a name “wordpress_logged_in_.+” it makes internal redirect to this location: “location ~ ^/&lt;strong&gt;cached/.+.php$ {” which cuts off the “&lt;/strong&gt;cached” directory and loads the script from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve IT Risk policy, requests to wp-admin, wp-login.php and wp-register.php is handled by “location ~ (wp-(admin/.*|login|register).php$) {” location and ip addreses restricted by this line: “if ($remote_addr !~ xxx.x.xx..+|xxx.x.xx..+|xxx.xxx.xxx..+){ return 404; }”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems to me quite easy to understand, but it took all day to get to this. I guess there could be a better solution, but for now this works for me. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Build a computer</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/build-a-computer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-29T06:29:00+03:00</published><updated>2010-09-29T06:29:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-09-29:/en/build-a-computer.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to build my own computer.&lt;/p&gt;

Though there are some issues. For example translating is a nice thing, but it is global not per invoice. Mostly I need invoices in Latvian, but if I will need it in english I will have to translate it back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding a damn good wysiwyg editor</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/finding-a-damn-good-wysiwyg-editor.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-19T01:08:00+03:00</published><updated>2010-08-19T01:08:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-08-19:/en/finding-a-damn-good-wysiwyg-editor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need to find a good wysiwyg editor for a project i'm currently working on. Here are my thoughts on some of the editors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt; : feature full editor, but it seems a bit messy with a lot of files. Implementing is also not very nice and friendly. Earlier I have experianced some problems validating html code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FCKEditor / &lt;a href="http://ckeditor.com/"&gt;CKEditor&lt;/a&gt; : Some years ago it was called FCKEditor, now I see that they have renamed it to CKEditor. I have used this one quite successfully. This is definitely better that TinyCME. Just downloaded the source code and I see that download package consists of 579 files. Wow! I need some simple wysiwyg editor, not this huge. And directory structure is really messed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/"&gt;markItUp&lt;/a&gt; : 40 files - much better. Actually this is very interesting editor, althought it is not quite wysiwyg one. Judging from the example I have to replace "\n" to "&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;" within my code. I don't want to do that. And also for average user html code will not be easy to handle. On other hand pasting documents from word and websites …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need to find a good wysiwyg editor for a project i'm currently working on.

On other hand pasting documents from word and websites will end up with better results. It is also nice looking. So there are some pros and cons to consider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/jwysiwyg/"&gt;jWYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; : So called jQuery wysiwyg editor. This one was my favourite for some time because of small footprint. It have only 3 files - js, css, and a gif file for a toolbar. Why I don't use it any more? Firstly it has a bad design. Next some features does not work very good on some browsers. There was some bug when slecting text in bold, toolbar do not show it is in bold. Also toolbar icons is somehow shifted. There was something else, I can't remeber now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nicedit.com/"&gt;NicEdit&lt;/a&gt; : They have nice website, also nice looking editor. This one I am currently using, but I'm searching for something else because there is no "html code" button as well as it cannot clean messy html code. And you can image what comes with when you copy something from the microsoft word. However this is really nice editor with small source - only two files - ideal if you need just some bold, italic text and some lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openwebware.com/"&gt;openWYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; : Didn't know about this one, so I gave it a try. 109 files in default archive. Quite much, but they seem good structured, not like Tiny and CK. From example I see, that it have table support, what does not have all those two files simple editors. Oh! It defines $ as shortcut to javascript "document.getElementById" function - this is bad, very bad, because I use $ to access jQuery. Ok, lets stop here: "openWYSIWYG does not support your browser" - I'm using google chrome. It seemed the good one... :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freerichtexteditor.com/"&gt;FreeRichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt; : Another rich text editor. This one has interesting switching between editor, html code and first one I see - Preview. It looks good, but not very good. But it also seems somehow left alone. It has only one version and author writes new posts twice a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://batiste.dosimple.ch/blog/2007-09/"&gt;jQuery RTE&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://remiya.com/cms/projects/jquery-plugins/htmlbox/"&gt;HtmlBox&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.avidansoft.com/dsrte/index.php"&gt;dsrte&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.wymeditor.org/demo/"&gt;WYMEditor&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://xinha.webfactional.com/"&gt;Xinha&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.htmlarea.com/"&gt;htmlArea&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://koivi.com/WYSIWYG-Editor/"&gt;TTW HTML&lt;/a&gt; : I would choose none of these ones just because they have very bad designs and first impression about theire websites does it all even worse. Also I don't see any future for these ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion is that there is no prefect solution. Currently choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feature full, but ugly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to use and implement, but feature less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice looking and easy to implement, but not friendly for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully featured, but very heavy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way the best editor I have seen have wordpress and I see, that posterous is also using something similar. Maybe somebody knows if it can be downloaded separately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note about WYSIWYM editors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see where so called WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editors could be handy, I would better use markup editor. If website admin is an average user, I guess he/she doesn't care if the text is in p tag, or div tag. One of these is &lt;a href="http://www.wymeditor.org/demo/"&gt;WYMEditor&lt;/a&gt; . See example here: &lt;a href="http://files.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/trunk/src/examples/01-basic.html"&gt;http://files.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/trunk/src/examples/01-basic.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.s. I am fan of jQuery, so I did leave out editors based on js libraries such as mootools, django, yahoo UI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Port forwarding</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/port-forwarding.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-16T23:43:00+03:00</published><updated>2010-08-16T23:43:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-08-16:/en/port-forwarding.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yestereday it wasn't very creative day at work so I took a work with me using usb flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess I did know it before, just somehow haven't thought about it. What I need was a server. I can't use any server, again because of strict IT policy, but recently we rent a new server outside of our work environment for one project and I have an access to it from my work PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should I do next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me port forwarding is included in ssh client/server and all I have to do is to put right parameters in command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to connect my computer to the server and open port xxx and yyy (ssh and www) that will be forwarded to our dev server at work (192.168.10.10 is an example for dev server in work's local environment):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ssh -R 127.0.0.1:xxx:192.168.10.10:22 -R 127.0.0.1:yyy:192.168.10.10:80 &lt;a href="mailto:username@example.org"&gt;username@example.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch -R means that we will be forwarding remote port to local. 127.0.0.1 is for security so no one else from outside world do not guess the port and avoid any vulnerabilities to the dev server. "xxx" and "yyy" is ports to open on remote machine. "192.168.10.10:22" is ip address and port where to forward incoming connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing to do is create a tunnel from my home computer to the server. You can leave "127.0.0.1:" out from -R switch and connect directly to the server by opening &lt;a href="http://example.org"&gt;http://example.org&lt;/a&gt; :yyy/ and ssh -p xxx &lt;a href="mailto:username@example.org"&gt;username@example.org&lt;/a&gt; . Considering security expectations at my work I would choose to create a tunnel from my home computer to the server either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ssh -L xxx:127.0.0.1:xxx -L yyy:127.0.0.1:yyy &lt;a href="mailto:username@example.org"&gt;username@example.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where "-L" tells ssh to forward local incoming port to "xxx" and "yyy" to the server (127.0.0.1 is server's local ip address, what everybody knows already:) on port "xxx" and "yyy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on my home computer I open &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1"&gt;http://127.0.0.1&lt;/a&gt; :xxx/ and it should open a default website from our dev server. As we use apache virtualhosts on our dev I would have to set some entries in hosts file to get other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,
We love that you love our product and use it as much as you do. We have observed however, that a website you are tracking with Google Analytics is sending over 1 million hits per day to Google Analytics servers. This is well above the "5 million pageviews per month per account" limit specified in the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html"&gt;Google Analytics Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; . Processing this amount of data multiple times a day takes up valuable resources that enable us to continue to develop the product for all Google Analytics users.
As such, starting August 23rd, 2010, the metrics in your reports will be updated once a day, as opposed to multiple times during the course of the day. You will continue to receive all the reports and features in Google Analytics as usual. The only change will be that data for a given day will appear the following day.
We trust you understand the reasons for this change.

Your Google Analytics Team&lt;/p&gt;

One of them is MongoDB so called “NoSQL” database.What I have learned is that mongoDB is very simple. Running MongoDB and installation of PHP extension for it, took only some 10 minutes. Then fast overview of some source code at php.net manual and we are good to go. If you have some earlier experience with javascript and databases like MySQL, you shouldn’t have any problems with MongoDB. This morning I started to migrate table from MySQL to Mongo and did a mistake. I changed table in MySQL query but did not changed it in Mongo insert. So what I had was two tables in one Mongo collection.Fortunately those tables has some fields that are not in other table, so I came up with this code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;self::$mdb-&amp;gt;i18n-&amp;gt;remove(array(&amp;#39;:where&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; new mongoCode(&amp;#39;return (this.parent == 0 || this.parent &amp;gt; 0) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; typeof this.last_access == &amp;quot;undefined&amp;quot;;&amp;#39;)));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where “self::$mdb” is reference to php MongoDB object. I guess: “typeof this.last_access == "undefined”;“ would be just fine, either, but I used "this.parent” for double checking. Another problem with Mongo is to get max value of some field, so I decided to paste a code here to also remember this one if in case I need it someday. It finds max value of field “id” in collection “countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;  $max_id = self::$mdb-&amp;gt;execute(new mongoCode(&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    find_max = [];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    db.properties.find([], {id : 1}).map(function(item){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        if (item.id)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;            find_max.push(parseFloat(item.id));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    });&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    return Math.max.apply(Math, find_max);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;&amp;#39;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="x"&gt;print_r($max_id[&amp;#39;retval&amp;#39;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is pure JavaScript inside of Mongo, so if you know javascript getting advanced stuff out of Mongo should be very easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2010"></category></entry><entry><title>Excavation and my coupe</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/excavation-and-my-coupe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-03T19:30:00+03:00</published><updated>2010-08-03T19:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2010-08-03:/en/excavation-and-my-coupe.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/JigJoDptozHnAeFJjIruaCzeyrhfuynqbpGexbGzGGwxAikwuagumfrzadFt_IMG_0002.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Img_0002" src="/images/JigJoDptozHnAeFJjIruaCzeyrhfuynqbpGexbGzGGwxAikwuagumfrzadFt_IMG_0002.jpg.scaled696.jpg"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with &lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/eu/"&gt;parallels&lt;/a&gt; , because I wanted to do some other tasks, also and because of windows 7 beta installation on bootcamp disk.

&lt;p&gt;I understand that crm is working very closely with MS Outlook and MSSQL, so I installed MS Office and went to microsoft.com for mssql. I found MSSQL Express, which is for free, actually. After installing mssql I mounted crm server iso file and started installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I was introduced with a lot of "Required components". Ok, that is not so bad, press install and everything gets installed. After some time of waiting and "reboot required", but ignored and error dialog popping up, comes next step. I filled organization name, next, next, next and then error dialog: "IIS is not installed". That made me wonder, but ok, there is checkbox "Create a new Web site", next. Then appeared "Select SQL Server" page. Crm server setup didn't find it, so I just put in localhost and pressed "next". There was something about "reporting services", wtf? Ok, "next". And here came a joy. It asked me for "Organizational unit". I have heard that word set before, but I didn't want to agree with myself. So I pressed the button - "Browse" and got a message: "Unable to browse for &lt;strong&gt;Active Directory&lt;/strong&gt; object". That wasn't so good, anymore.
Next I opened up google and searched for something like this: "active directory windows xp" and got back site, where somebody has wrote something like this: "You can't get Active Directory on windows xp". I already knew it, even before pressing that "Browse" button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking to myself: "OK!", and searched for windows server. First result was directing to microsoft web site, where I could download windows server beta version, so I did it. it was quite fast, installed, did it all again. Then something I don't remember, was not happy with windows 2008 server beta, this is where I started to become angry. "Ok, fine, fine." I searched again, downloaded windows 2003 server edition. This was not so fast any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had windows 2003 server iso file, now. Ok, I opened parallels, "New Virtual Machine", "next", "next", some configuration and done. Fresh windows 2003 server was installed and didn't let me to download a file from microsoft web site, because of security. After I somehow manage to get that file I installed MS Office and MSSQL 2008 express. Went to google, searched how to install Active Directory, even created one user in it. Then I mounted Microsoft dynamics CRM server, "install", "next", "next", "error dialog", "next", "next", "Browse". It shows up as neded, "ok", "next". Stop!! "Microsoft exchange", "WTF???" This is where I got really angry, but i told to myself: "there is no need for a panic!". Google: "install exchange server" -&amp;gt; downloaded exchange server, installed and there was some requirements in process, too, for example SMTP server, what is hidden somewhere in "Add/Remove windows components". Finally, reboot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount MSCRM, "install", "next", "next". "Next" after "Exchange server" page - everything is ok. Setup was checking installation, here we go again. It told me, that something is wrong with database. I changed passwords, I changed service users and passwords, I was going mad, when I wrote a query for google: "microsoft dynamics crm 3 mssql 2008 express" and found link, where somebody wrote something similar to this: "in order to install microsoft crm you will need to get enterprise or standard version of mssql". At this point I understood: "that is microsoft, there is no point of being mad, just go, search for mssql 2005 enterprise, download it .. install and that's it". So I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presuming that I had already installed mssql (too lazy to write those "next", "error", "next"), I was at last page of crm installation and everything was fine, so I pressed "install" button and after that "close" button. Then I was sitting in my chair and asking myself: "So that's it? It really went without any errors?" (with sarcasm, of course)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing was, that I have to somehow connect to crm to actually do something with it. Somewhere between all those installations I found out, that it has soap module, server or whatever you call it. I just needed to find what url I have to connect. And you may guess, that it wasn't an easy step, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I came accross, was msdn web site, there is something like documentation. So I walked around a little bit, found nothing and went to google, of course. :) Google said, that there is url like this: "http://localhost:5555/MSCRMservices/2006/crmservice.asmx", I opened it in Safari, it was asking for username and password. I entered tht usernames login information I created earlier, guess - it won't work. Aah.. After some searhing around I found out, that I need to add my users to CRM (or Exchange) server. So I did it and tried again, it worked. I got the page, with some little information about possible commands to the server. Of course it wasn't quite that I was looking for. So I googled again. I came accross link - "http://10.211.55.5:5555/MSCRMservices/2006/crmservice.asmx?wsdl" and, yes, it was soap connector, finally. But that is where the funniest part starts. Microsoft uses their authentication method called NTLM and, of course, there is no support for in-built soap client. Ok, there was some .. exactly one example in several web sites, what isn't working quite as well as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some looking around I went over php based library &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/"&gt;nusoap&lt;/a&gt; . Nusoap have NTLM support. "Yes!" - I thought to myself. What's next? I have to find how to communicate with ms soap server. And you know, it is not so easy as it sounds. There are plenty of examples around, but they all are hand made xml, but I have nusoap class, what does it self. I just have to put right values in right places. And that is not so easy either. It started here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and ended here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should I put in all those method arguments? Searched all over google, no example, nothing, just stupid msdn documentation web site with class reference, what is totally useless, if I don't know how to use it. So that was it. I started to think about other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One I came up with was, that I could include mscrm in-built web client into iframe and all done, but as always it is not that simple. Firstly because users will have to enter their username and password again, and that is not worse thing. The even worse thing that in-built web client works only and only on microsoft internet explorer. So I asked myself: "What is that? CRM? It should be useful, not painful".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iframe solution didn't worked out, so I thought I could just make some php wrapper/proxy for that web client so users have just one limitation on browsers. I got it working with curl, but not quite working. I got through html code, what wasn't working either way. That was the moment I stopped doing anything and right after that opened parallels virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched through all start menu items and didn't find anything that would be useable for mssql database browsing. I went to google, again. Searched for some tool. Google pointed me to microsoft web site. There is a tool named "Microsoft SQL web data administrator". I downloaded it, installed, launched, pressed start button. Internet explorer opened automatically to local address what gave me out and error. "F#!@@£% microsoft..".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through all menu items searching for something that would be useable to change some permissions stuff in mssql. Nothing. Aaagh... I opened google for the last time, searched something, got answer that I need some "mssql studio.." thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only thing that came into my mind was - "Ok, that's it. I'm done here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm sitting in my chair and thinking: "How microsoft manage to get people to use their really stupid setups? Really, how?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ubuntu server edition this all would take me like half an hour job? I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

rm -R /var/www/&lt;em&gt;
mv -R ./SugarCE-5.2.0a/&lt;/em&gt; /var/www/
+ some little configuration and my crm website is ready to use. What about integration into another site. &lt;a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/wiki/index.php?title=SOAP_Documentation"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt;  looks much better, than &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa683647.aspx"&gt;msdn&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

I do understand that there is crisis out there and we need to lower our expanses, but how can they cut off teacher salaries, what has always been to low and leave their unchanged. From what I have heared, they will talk about to cutt off their bonuses or not. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we live in the country like this, when there is such a lot absurd and wories about tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2009"></category></entry><entry><title>Wordpress updated</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/wordpress-updated.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-15T22:57:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-01-15T22:57:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2009-01-15:/en/wordpress-updated.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Little late, but I just updated my wordpress version to 2.7 and it looks great.

&lt;p&gt;Some of the features:&lt;/p&gt;

Although there is some annoying things about pdo. For example, you cannot count on PDOStatement-&amp;gt;rowCount method, because it works only on affected rows, not selected. Some of the database types can return row count number on select too, but you can't truly be sure, if you admit that in some point you could change database.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It can handle javascript trough php for example for some language handling in javascript. Have to think about this more seriously, because sometimes you need to provide some other stuff to javascript;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is really fast, at least I would like to think it is. :) I am looking forward how to test this correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost every site I have build I needed more that one language and some sort of administration. So I also have some ideas about these two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things to do for framework it self, including bug tracker, forum, documentation, examples, etc. Fortunately I can't promise when exactly will be first releases, but I'm working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't put big hopes for the site, this mainly is just for the framework to evolve.

&lt;p&gt;Little late to say: "merry Christmass". Lot of stuff is going on, lately, and I just have no time for blogging.
