Here is what I have found. This guide is for nvidia with a better GPU than CPU (apparently that stuff matters), and most probably won't work for everyone, but you can find ideas to increase performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid hdd, go for ssd or even better M.2 NMVE drive. Last one loads games, and system it self, million times faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for performance middle ground. For example, download OpenHardwareMonitor, check that CPU and GPU utilisation, is somewhat consistent. Later on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a decent mouse and keyboard, especially mouse. Upgrading generic mouse to SteelSeries Rival was like a day versus night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is an option for you, go for a 144Hz monitor. Even if your computer can handle only 90fps, its still a lot better than 60Hz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the G-Sync and V-Sync, it does make the game to look quite a bit smoother, but if you want maximum performance, I suggest turning it off …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Gints Murāns</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 17:46:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gm.lv,2018-11-20:/en/ultimate-guide-to-solve-pubg-stuttering-issues.html</guid><category>Games</category><category>Pubg</category></item></channel></rss>
