&lt;li&gt;Update (2020-02-03): Brought some things up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been "whining" on reddit about pubg issues for a while now, &lt;s&gt;and I think I finally figured it out.&lt;/s&gt; - to be honest pubg is a weird game. I have been playing lot of COD:MW lately and some CS:GO too, and sometimes I win, sometimes I lose there, as it should be cosidering that I am quite average gamer here. But PUBG is an annoying nightmare, nothing works for me, I lose 95% of time even if its not an RNG case. Anyway the following is still relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take a look at my &lt;a href="http://gm.lv/en/ultimate-guide-to-solve-pubg-stuttering-issues.html"&gt;other post&lt;/a&gt; on how to get a better performance in Pubg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets start from the beginning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together a computer just for gaming around a year ago. At the time x299 chipset just came out and I thought - the newer, the better, so I bought Aorus Gaming 3, X299 + i5-7640x + HyperX FURY DDR4-2133 with some generic (shitty) PSU, RX550 GPU, generic mouse and keyboard, SSD, and upgraded stock cooler to a better one from Cooler …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Gints Murāns</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 16:02:00 +0300</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gm.lv,2019-05-03:/en/another-pubg-issue.html</guid><category>Games</category><category>Games</category><category>Pubg</category></item><item><title>Ultimate guide to solve PUBG stuttering issues</title><link>http://gm.lv/en/ultimate-guide-to-solve-pubg-stuttering-issues.html</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update (2020-02-03): Brought some things up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update (2019-05-03): Few typo and speeling fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have been fighting with fps drops and stuttering issues for quite a while now, and I have a decent system. Here is what I have found. This guide is for nvidia with a better GPU than CPU (apparently that stuff matters), and most probably won't work for everyone, but you can find ideas to increase performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid hdd, go for ssd or even better M.2 NMVE drive. Last one loads games, and system it self, million times faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for performance middle ground. For example, download OpenHardwareMonitor, check that CPU and GPU utilisation is somewhat consistent. Later on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a decent mouse and keyboard, especially mouse. &lt;s&gt;Upgrading generic mouse to SteelSeries Rival was like a day versus night for me.&lt;/s&gt; Switched to Logitech G305 and don't want to ever look back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is an option for you, go for a 144Hz monitor. Even if your computer can handle only 90fps, its still a lot better than 60Hz …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Gints Murāns</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 17:46:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gm.lv,2018-11-20:/en/ultimate-guide-to-solve-pubg-stuttering-issues.html</guid><category>Games</category><category>Games</category><category>Pubg</category></item></channel></rss>
