So if you want to hide back button you have to hide it in first view controller and then push the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have many places where you need to push new view controllers and have back button, but only one place where it needs to be set it is not very efficient to set it every time to not hidden. The solution is this code called from view controller pushed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parentViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;navigationItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setHidesBackButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to show it when view disapears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also applies to custom back buttons - you have to apply it to first view controller, not the one is being pushed on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry><entry><title>Comparing posterous and google analytics statistics</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/comparing-posterous-and-google-analytics-statistics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-22T18:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-22T18:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-03-22:/en/comparing-posterous-and-google-analytics-statistics.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Of course I would like to have my site viewed as much as posterous says, but I think I can be sure, that google analytics is more correct.

Basically these things that came with new macbook pro are not so important to replace the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets start with features new macbook pro has, but they can't buy me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderbolt.&lt;/strong&gt; The speed seems amazing (10 Gbps), but most probably the first time I will use it will be after some 5 years, as I am not compressing and storing any big video files, images, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster, better video card.&lt;/strong&gt; Cool to have it, right? But in real world I don't see any downside of the one I currently have. Really I haven't seen any problems that could apply to video card. I am not playing games very much..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next-generation quad-core and dual-core Intel processors.&lt;/strong&gt; This is also pretty cool, and actually sometimes I feel like my old macbook could be little faster, especially when I started learning iPhone development. But it is not like the current 2.4 GHz CPU is lagging.&lt;/p&gt;

But it is not like the current 2.4 GHz CPU is lagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery.&lt;/strong&gt; My current macbook can still hold up to 3 hours, so the battery is not why I should buy the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand I would like to have these ones, but they still are not ice breakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDXC Card reader.&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah it would be nice to have the option, but would you buy a new laptop just for SD card reader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime HD camera.&lt;/strong&gt; Macbook cameras has always been very good, this one seems even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would make me buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluray.&lt;/strong&gt; I had some 40GB of photos that I accidentally deleted. So I was really hoping, that in spite of internet comments apple would surprise everyone and put it in the new macbook. They didn't, shame for them. This would really be the key for me to buy it. If we do some math, then I need 10+ DVD disks to save all those pictures + DVD are still quite unreliable and it is not that I will have smaller amounts of pictures after writing all those 40GB. Now with bluray I could write two copies of pictures in two disks instead of 10 unreliable dvd disks in one copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen Resolution.&lt;/strong&gt; This is another disappointment. Apple increased screen resolution for macbook air and now it is larger than new macbook pro has. I am used to work on 13" laptop and I don't want to change that, but larger resolution would make me much happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USB.&lt;/strong&gt; 2 usb ports are just too less. 4 is optimal. I know, that their number will never be increased, but still. Lets assume that I have iphone charging in one of usb ports and wired mouse into another one. Now when I need to attach photo camera I have to pull one out, but I don't want to, because iPhone needs to be charged, but I need the mouse to operate (which I don't, but I am trying to make a point here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something really, really cool, that nobody has made yet.&lt;/strong&gt; Like that 3D desktop that was going around the internet once, or I don't know, controlling mouse with my mind. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have unibody as I have 3 years old macbook white. It is really cool, but it is just a fancy thing as an add-on to the price we are paying. We all know apple is not quite cheap. Please don't misunderstand me, I am not complaining that they cost too much. I am very happy that I bought one those 3 years ago. I have reinstalled it once in 3 years, I can't complain about anything. :) I am just saying that unibody is not a reason to buy new laptop if current one if working just fine. Still for the first time, I am disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, in the next faster, better, never seen before release of MacBooks, please, include also really useful things, not just fancy faster toys.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry><entry><title>Sleepy Louise</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/sleepy-louise.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-22T12:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-01-22T12:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-01-22:/en/sleepy-louise.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is another video with little Louise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry><entry><title>Code Cards v1.2</title><link href="https://gm.lv/en/code-cards-v12.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-11T23:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-01-11T23:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Gints Murāns</name></author><id>tag:gm.lv,2011-01-11:/en/code-cards-v12.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to mention, that since yestereday &lt;a href="http://codecards.gm.lv/"&gt;Code Cards 1.2&lt;/a&gt;  have been approved and is available on &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-cards/id412350680?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

What they do is, they print pictures on a glass.

Yes, I have made an iPhone app and it is published, but lets start with one other thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides my day job I have started to work for a new, amazing startup called "Fracture" (&lt;a href="http://www.fractureme.com/"&gt;http://www.fractureme.com/&lt;/a&gt; ). Currently it is more like a freelancer job for various tasks. As I already mentioned it is a new startup run by Alex Theodore and Abhi Lokesh. The whole story about how the idea showed up and on you can read in &lt;a href="http://www.fractureme.com/fracture-digital-printing-company"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;  section, if you are interested.

&lt;p&gt;About learning. Some month ago, college of mine came up with an idea. You see in Latvia we use username, password and phisical code cards (there are other options, mostly paid solutions) to authenticate within online internet baking websites. So this college of mine thought: "How cool would be if my code card would be stored on my phone and I wouldn't have to take that card with me?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I thought: "What a nice idea." Then we talk a bit about it and as I have macbook and he have android mobile phone, we decided that I will create an iPhone version, but he Android's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been very interesting experiance, because it has been a long time since my last compile-type development. On other hand I have never thought about memory allocation and releasing so much as with this app. From beginning when I saw Objective-C I thought - wtf? - quares all around. But now it somehow seems kind of a cool language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to dive into specifics of language as this blog post is meant to be only superficial overview of what I am doing, maybe next time. Anyway, the application now is published in &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-cards/id412350680?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; . It took 3 days for apple to publish it, suprisingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it for iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few days ago I thought I could make some android live wallpaper and sell it. :) At that point I didn't know what to make so I left the thought alone. A day later I somehow remebered a little work I made ~10 years ago on pascal. It was just some random circles showing in random sizes. You know the rest. :) You can find it on market searching for Circles Live Wallpaper or lv.gm.circleslivewallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are also a little demo video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EFyp294g1U"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Google market ir really not so advanced as Apple, but it have one advantage over it - you don't have to wait for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to say nice words about Chrome Extensions. It is so simple to create one, I am really amazed. I will leave this for another post, because it is late and it is another topic, just wanted to highlight Chrome. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sākums"></category><category term="2011"></category></entry></feed>
