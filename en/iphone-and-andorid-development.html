                <p>This has been a very busy month. I even don't know where to start. Yes, I have made an iPhone app and it is published, but lets start with one other thing.</p>
<p>Besides my day job I have started to work for a new, amazing startup called "Fracture" (<a href="http://www.fractureme.com/">http://www.fractureme.com/</a> ). Currently it is more like a freelancer job for various tasks. As I already mentioned it is a new startup run by Alex Theodore and Abhi Lokesh. The whole story about how the idea showed up and on you can read in <a href="http://www.fractureme.com/fracture-digital-printing-company">About</a>  section, if you are interested. What they do is, they print pictures on a glass. Then they put a simple handling hole behind it, pack it in <a href="http://www.fractureme.com/blog/2010/01/21/fracture-crash-and-safety-testing-we-passed/">a very resistant package</a> and ship it to you. They will even add a screw so you can put it on the wall right away. We ordered one fracture as an example and it was so cool so I decided to apply for php position there. They agreed and in this little time I have learned some new things and I hope more will come. :)</p>
<p>About learning. Some month ago, college of mine came up with an idea. You see in Latvia we use username, password and phisical code cards (there are other options, mostly paid solutions) to authenticate within online internet baking websites. So this college of mine thought: "How cool would be if my code card would be stored on my phone and I wouldn't have to take that card with me?".</p>
<p>And I thought: "What a nice idea." Then we talk a bit about it and as I have macbook and he have android mobile phone, we decided that I will create an iPhone version, but he Android's.</p>
<p>It has been very interesting experiance, because it has been a long time since my last compile-type development. On other hand I have never thought about memory allocation and releasing so much as with this app. From beginning when I saw Objective-C I thought - wtf? - quares all around. But now it somehow seems kind of a cool language.</p>
<p>I don't want to dive into specifics of language as this blog post is meant to be only superficial overview of what I am doing, maybe next time. Anyway, the application now is published in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-cards/id412350680?mt=8&amp;ls=1">App Store</a> . It took 3 days for apple to publish it, suprisingly fast.</p>
<p>That is it for iPhone.</p>
<p>Few days ago I thought I could make some android live wallpaper and sell it. :) At that point I didn't know what to make so I left the thought alone. A day later I somehow remebered a little work I made ~10 years ago on pascal. It was just some random circles showing in random sizes. You know the rest. :) You can find it on market searching for Circles Live Wallpaper or lv.gm.circleslivewallpaper.</p>

<p>Here are also a little demo video:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EFyp294g1U"></a> Google market ir really not so advanced as Apple, but it have one advantage over it - you don't have to wait for approval.</p>
<p>I also want to say nice words about Chrome Extensions. It is so simple to create one, I am really amazed. I will leave this for another post, because it is late and it is another topic, just wanted to highlight Chrome. :)</p>
