Par to pašu tēmu runājot.

te - [links](http://www.slowleadership.org/2005/11/saving-time.html), atradu labo tekstu: "Our organizational systems are out of balance. Education isn't providing the skills companies need. The cost of fringe benefits is distorting employment patterns. That's why we have people shortages and significant unemployment at the same time. Yet we rush ahead, convinced running faster will somehow cure the problem. One day, we will have to stop. Let's hope it's before we hit a brick wall of business and personal collapse."

vēl kaut kas: "Rushed, frantic leadership is no leadership at all."
