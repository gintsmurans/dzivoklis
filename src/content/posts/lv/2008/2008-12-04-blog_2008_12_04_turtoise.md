Here we have a little sweety, heart breaking and taking - turtoise. I have been fascinating about turtles so long time. And now, finaly, he is here. He is something about 7-10 years old and 9.5cm long. He has no name and will be given one by next week.

For now he is only sleeping and quite slowly walking to corner where he could sleep. :) Real actions will see after 2-3 months. :)
