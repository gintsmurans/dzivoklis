.. and happy new year! :)

Little late to say: "merry Christmass". Lot of stuff is going on, lately, and I just have no time for blogging. Ok, that is only my excuse. :) anyway i have a lot on my mind and I'm currently working on one site (what i will show to the world very soon:) while working on my own framework too. What concerns to framework, I have a lot of questions to answer (mainly: "what is the best way to do this and/or that").

What for now, i'm going to bed, and hopefully I will try to do some more writing!!

P.s. Sorry for my not-so-good english.
