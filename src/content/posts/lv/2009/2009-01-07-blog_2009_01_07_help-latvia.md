So there it is - [http://helplatvia.lv][1] . I have been working for some while on this project after watching interview in bloomberg television (wee all now what interview). Still there are some improvements to make. As everybody knows, I'm not a designer, so don't blame me for the look of the site, but suggestions are more than welcome.

I don't put big hopes for the site, this mainly is just for the framework to evolve. And I have some pretty nice ideas to make it little different from all frameworks. :)
