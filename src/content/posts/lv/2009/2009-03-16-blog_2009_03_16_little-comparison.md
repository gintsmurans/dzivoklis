Yesterday i wrote a little comparison test. Let an image show you the rest.more

Strange thing is that first time running php, it was a lot slower than ruby, bet still faster than java. And what for "Scala" - I put it here because I read that some part of twitter are using it. It is so slow when comparing to others so I saw no point to include it in *files* test.

[Here are all files needed to make the test.][2]
