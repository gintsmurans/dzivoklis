And here is another one. :) This time I am against Internet Explorer 6. Inspiration came after reading this [blog post][1] . I think we all should follow Norway in this one, so I made a little html + css script.

Put that little source on your page and result will be similar to the one in picture, what is in Latvian, but below is download link to English version, too:
