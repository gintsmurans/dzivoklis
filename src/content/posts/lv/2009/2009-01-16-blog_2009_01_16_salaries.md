How can it be, that goverment is cutting off salaries for every unit, but leaving their self salaries as they were? So imagine preschool teacher, who have and had salary something about 250 ls after taxes and they had some bonuses. Now they don't. And now imagine some fat guy sitting in our government and getting salary something about 4000 ls more or less and without any wish to lower they incoms. They are threating us like an idiots. I do understand that there is crisis out there and we need to lower our expanses, but how can they cut off teacher salaries, what has always been to low and leave their unchanged. From what I have heared, they will talk about to cutt off their bonuses or not. :D

So how can we live in the country like this, when there is such a lot absurd and wories about tomorrow?
