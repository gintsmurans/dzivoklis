Some time ago I was searching how to get "now playing" status from itunes to show in skype. Then I did not find anything. Today I remembered it and decided to try search again. I found nothing and with nothing I mean I couldn't find any application that could do that. But instead I found this forum post - [http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=83508][1]  what made me wonder. So I looked in Skype settings and there it is - Cmd+, -&gt; Advanced tab -&gt; "Show iTunes song in my mood message". Simple enough. :)

p.s. I don't know if this works on windows skype too.
