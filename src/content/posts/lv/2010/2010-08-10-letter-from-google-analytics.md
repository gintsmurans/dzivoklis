Today I received an email from google analytics team. It makes me feel kind of proud. :)

> Hello,
We love that you love our product and use it as much as you do. We have observed however, that a website you are tracking with Google Analytics is sending over 1 million hits per day to Google Analytics servers. This is well above the "5 million pageviews per month per account" limit specified in the [Google Analytics Terms of Service][1] . Processing this amount of data multiple times a day takes up valuable resources that enable us to continue to develop the product for all Google Analytics users.
As such, starting August 23rd, 2010, the metrics in your reports will be updated once a day, as opposed to multiple times during the course of the day. You will continue to receive all the reports and features in Google Analytics as usual. The only change will be that data for a given day will appear the following day.
We trust you understand the reasons for this change.
Regards,
Your Google Analytics Team

Getting data updated once a day is not a very good thing, but getting to it because of big amount of data is a good thing. :)
