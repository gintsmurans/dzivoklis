Few days ago we decided to sell our [Canon EOS 400D][1] photo camera. It was a good purchase, but it somehow was too far from our needs as we mostly took pictures in auto or P mode. Yesterday we actually sold it. Now it was time to look for the new one.

Our requirements was that is has to be small, fit into 200 LVL price range and have to be qualitative. After reviewing a lot of cameras we came to two models: [Canon SX 210 IS][2]  and [Sony DSC-T99][3] . Canon offers more control, sony offers smaller size and cooler looking.
Me and my wife we both decided to go for sony, but I couldn't find it in any LV internet shop so I decided to go for canon. As well, reading through some of the posts in forums, confirmed my choice.

Now it is 4:30 am, I have already ordered SX210, so I can finally go to sleep. :)
