Today I had to put a site on production server that uses mongodb. It included installing of mongodb it self. MongoDB comes as a binary download and currently is not a part of ubuntu distribution. It also does not comes with a startup script with it. I searched over google and found some not very good examples, so I decided to create it from ubuntu nginx startup script. As this was already third or fourth time I do this, I thought I should place it somewhere so I don't have to do it again. Here it is on github: [https://github.com/gintsmurans/mongodb-startup-scripts][1]

You are welcome to fork it and add other distribution startup scripts and also suggest changes to ubuntu script.
