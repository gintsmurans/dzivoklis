Few weeks ago I bought a brand new Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini pro (what a name). And I am disappointed in it. I thought 2.1 version would make some difference, but it does not. It is better, but still not good enough. And even getting the actual 2.1 update was big times fail.

Key points:

1. Battery. It is a fu..ing disaster. Today I actually tried to turn on what I would like to use everyday. It last 6 hours before battery was empty. 6 fu..king hours. It is called a mobile phone, not desktop PC. I guess turning off skype would last some 4 hours more, but still. 10 hours (without wifi and gps turned on)? iPhone 3G with push gmail did hold up to two days. When I turn off every part i can, it lasts only for a day, if I use it little more actively I charge it twice a day. Playing angry birds increased it to 3-4 times a day, last rounds I played plugged in. Charger cable now is like a wallet, keys and mobile it self - always with me. :D
2. Touch screen. 1.6 was some kind of nightmare. If I put it on the table, the sliding was not working at all, I had to hold it still in my hand and then slide. But even then sliding over icons stops somewhere at some icon and executes it. In some applications it became so annoying. I wanted to slide over my tweets, but instead what I got was push on the first tweet, still sliding down, push on the menu item and voila I had a new favorite tweet against my will. With 2.1 android is a lot better, but still it seems somehow inaccurate.
3. Mysterious stuff. The are some stupid and unexplainable things happening. For example I turn it off with no notifications on, but when I turn it on, missed calls shows up, new messages shows up. I pushed the button clear to not to show me those. Next I open notification bar with clean "desktop", but when I slide it up some application is already opened instead of "desktop". Wireless connection is dead after some idle time, but it still shows as connected.
4. Performance. Overall performance is good. It is better than it was on iPhone 3G with 4.0 iOS, but it is not perfect. Angry birds lags a lot. I get it, it have only around 600 Mhz (My first computer has 1Ghz? :D).
5. The whole phone OS seems so random. On the iphone I had a feeling, that it is united system with inside applications. On other hand Android feels .. well a lot like linux - incomplete. Graphics is not so appealing, just like most of linux distros. Like thousands pieces comes together as one system with no information about others. I hope you see the point I'm trying to make here.

On other hand Sony Ericsson have made mini pro nice looking. I really like it's size, design and it's hardware keyboard. But battery is not acceptable.

Now I am thinking wether to test new blackberry torch or not. It seems nice, but applications running on Java somehow scares me. :) I instantly imagine all those windows Java applications with that cool gray background and little lighter stripes. I will find some time to get to my GSM provider to see it in action.
