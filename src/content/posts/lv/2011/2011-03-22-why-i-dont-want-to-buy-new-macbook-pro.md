I do want to have it, because I have 3 years old macbook white, but there are things keeping me away from buying it. Basically these things that came with new macbook pro are not so important to replace the old one.

Lets start with features new macbook pro has, but they can't buy me.

**Thunderbolt.** The speed seems amazing (10 Gbps), but most probably the first time I will use it will be after some 5 years, as I am not compressing and storing any big video files, images, etc.

**Faster, better video card.** Cool to have it, right? But in real world I don't see any downside of the one I currently have. Really I haven't seen any problems that could apply to video card. I am not playing games very much..

**Next-generation quad-core and dual-core Intel processors.** This is also pretty cool, and actually sometimes I feel like my old macbook could be little faster, especially when I started learning iPhone development. But it is not like the current 2.4 GHz CPU is lagging.

**Battery.** My current macbook can still hold up to 3 hours, so the battery is not why I should buy the new one.

On the other hand I would like to have these ones, but they still are not ice breakers.

**SDXC Card reader.** Yeah it would be nice to have the option, but would you buy a new laptop just for SD card reader?

**FaceTime HD camera.** Macbook cameras has always been very good, this one seems even more appealing.

What would make me buy it.

**Bluray.** I had some 40GB of photos that I accidentally deleted. So I was really hoping, that in spite of internet comments apple would surprise everyone and put it in the new macbook. They didn't, shame for them. This would really be the key for me to buy it. If we do some math, then I need 10+ DVD disks to save all those pictures + DVD are still quite unreliable and it is not that I will have smaller amounts of pictures after writing all those 40GB. Now with bluray I could write two copies of pictures in two disks instead of 10 unreliable dvd disks in one copy.

**Screen Resolution.** This is another disappointment. Apple increased screen resolution for macbook air and now it is larger than new macbook pro has. I am used to work on 13" laptop and I don't want to change that, but larger resolution would make me much happier.

**USB.** 2 usb ports are just too less. 4 is optimal. I know, that their number will never be increased, but still. Lets assume that I have iphone charging in one of usb ports and wired mouse into another one. Now when I need to attach photo camera I have to pull one out, but I don't want to, because iPhone needs to be charged, but I need the mouse to operate (which I don't, but I am trying to make a point here).

**Something really, really cool, that nobody has made yet.** Like that 3D desktop that was going around the internet once, or I don't know, controlling mouse with my mind. :D

I don't have unibody as I have 3 years old macbook white. It is really cool, but it is just a fancy thing as an add-on to the price we are paying. We all know apple is not quite cheap. Please don't misunderstand me, I am not complaining that they cost too much. I am very happy that I bought one those 3 years ago. I have reinstalled it once in 3 years, I can't complain about anything. :) I am just saying that unibody is not a reason to buy new laptop if current one if working just fine. Still for the first time, I am disappointed.

Apple, in the next faster, better, never seen before release of MacBooks, please, include also really useful things, not just fancy faster toys.
