The answer is no!

Here I have few apps open like: Chrome, Docker, vscode, Teams, Outlook web app, Spotify, Whatsapp, Notes, maybe some more, but nothing very specific that would hog the memory.

So if you buy one, I suggest to get Macbook pro with 16GB memory and I suggest you do, because its pretty awesome.
